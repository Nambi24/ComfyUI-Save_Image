**ComfyUI Save Image Custom Nodes**
This repository contains custom nodes for ComfyUI designed to enhance image file management and saving workflows. The nodes enable users to:

These nodes are ideal for automating image saving, organizing output directories, and handling file paths within ComfyUI projects.
